This repository is made for the purpose of Assignment B-1 project for STAT 545B. The repository will contain the Assignment B-1.Rmd file, as well as the knit Assignment B-1.md file. In these files, I have created a function called "createScatterplot" that allows me to create a scatterplot that is grouped by a character variable. This is very useful in performing repetitive tasks for my own research project, which requires me to graph a bunch of these scatterplots to check the shape of the curve. The assignment files explain the use for this code, as well as testing to make sure that it works in various situations.
